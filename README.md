# Mechatronics-Capstone
This repository contains code for designing and simulating a controller for a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA). This is a capstone project for the mechatronics option at the University of Washington Mechanical Engineering program.
## Usage
### Design the controllers
Go to the MATLAB directory and run design_controllers.m
### Run the code on the myRIO
Drag and drop all of the files in the C directory into an eclipse project set up to run ME 477 Lab 8. Then run main.c on the myRIO. After you end the run by pressing backspace on the keypad, transfer the file called SEA.mat from the myRIO to your pc.
### Analyze the data
Drop you new verion of SEA.mat into the MATLAB/data directory. Run review_data.m to view your new data in SEA.mat, or run nice_graphs.m to see some samples of past runs.
