# Mechatronics-Capstone
This repository contains code for designing and simulating a controller for a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA). This is a capstone project for the mechatronics option at the University of Washington Mechanical Engineering program.
## Usage
Run design_controllers.m to design the controllers, then run evaluate_controllers.m to view the performance of the controllers you designed.
